# What Sets Golden Batches Apart  
**A Data-Driven Framework for Analyzing Yield, Deviation Severity, and Timing**  
**Project 2**

---

## Overview

This project is a visual and statistical breakdown of what sets golden batches apart in biopharma manufacturing.

Using synthetic (non-sensitive) data, I explore batch performance patterns across yield, deviation count, deviation severity, and time. The goal is to help MSAT, Tech Ops, QA, and operations teams uncover early trends and improve future batch outcomes.

---

## Key Questions

- Which high performing ("golden") batches stood out, and why?
- How does deviation **count** relate to **severity** and **yield**?
- How might this kind of visual framework help prioritize batch reviews and reduce investigation fatigue?

---

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- DataCamp for training
- AI assistance for editing and workflow coaching
  > I used ChatGPT to review and debug code, clean up my explanations, and sharpen the structure. However, this project was driven by my own thinking and grounded in my real world experience working in biopharma operations.

## Why It Matters

In real world biomanufacturing, deviation reviews can feel endless, and itâ€™s easy to focus on quantity instead of impact.

This framework shifts the focus to severity weighted trends and batch timing, helping teams:

- Prioritize real risks

- Spot early warning signs

- Reflect on what sets successful runs apart

- Get comfortable using Python and Jupyter notebooks for real world analysis, and not just Excel

By building tools like this in code, teams can eventually automate parts of their process, generate more strategic insights, and reduce manual busywork.

## Note

All data in this project is completely synthetic and designed for demonstration and educational use. No real batch data or confidential information is used.
